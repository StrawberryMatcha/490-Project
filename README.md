# 490-Project

Team project aimed at creating a simple exam-taking platform for Python code with autograding implemented. I was responsible for frontend - creating and designing the webpages teachers and students would use to create, take, and grade exams. 

The full scope of the project (front, middle, back end) is hosted on NJIT's servers and accessing the full project is impossible without NJIT credentials. Refer to the imgur album for screen captures of the different webpages of the project.
